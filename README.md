ARC-VR is a Unity3D framework that aims to ameliorate the development process of VR applications or games by providing any and all basic VR features, such as movement, physics-interaction and UI. Thus ensuring the development process doesn't get congested at an early stage with the implementation of redundant, basic VR functionalities.

Built in-house at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Development](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en), the framework is primarily intended to simplify and streamline the building process of VR-based psychological experiments and studies.

The framework is still work-in-progress, largely untested and prone to bugs. Feel free to report any issues you encounter!

Here's a brief demonstration of the systems capabilities:
